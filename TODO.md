# TODO for Subtask 2: Design the Hero Section

- [x] Update index.html: Add a CTA button (e.g., "Shop Now") to the hero section that links to the products section.
- [x] Update styles/main.css: Add styles for the hero section including background gradient, flexbox centering, responsive design with media queries, hover effects on CTA button, and fade-in animation.
- [x] Test the hero section in browser for layout and responsiveness.
- [x] Ensure CTA button is functional and links correctly.
